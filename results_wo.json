Since acceleration \\( a \\) is inversely proportional to mass \\( m \\) for a given force \\( F \\), the lighter block will speed up the most.\n\nThe final answer is: D."

Each year, as Earth completes one full orbit around the sun, the positions of the stars seem to shift slightly due to this orbital movement. Thus, the apparent motion of the stars can be described as a yearly \"revolution\" because it reflects the Earth's revolution around the sun.\n\nThe final answer is: D."
