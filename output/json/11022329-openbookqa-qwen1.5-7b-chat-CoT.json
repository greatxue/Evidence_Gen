While exposed to harsh winds in a polar region: This is a likely scenario because cold winds can increase heat loss through convection and radiation, making it easier for the body to lose warmth.\nB. While stranded deep in a swamp: Although the cold water can be a factor, swamps can also be mucky and provide poor insulation, increasing heat loss.\nC.

        "ans_CoT": "The final answer is: C. A peony with wide, smooth leaves.\n\nSunlight absorption is generally related to leaf surface area and the ability to capture and convert light into energy (photosynthesis). Leaves with more surface area per unit volume tend to absorb more sunlight. In this case, peony leaves are wider and smoother compared to the other options:\n\n- A rose with tiny leaves might have fewer surface area per leaf, so it might absorb less sunlight.\n- A daisy with thin, short leaves might also have less surface area, but their small size could make it less significant than the difference between peony and the other options.\n- A daffodil with curled leaves might have some surface area, but the curls might reduce the overall surface area and thus absorb less sunlight than a flat leaf like a peony's.\n\nTherefore, a peony with wide, smooth leaves would absorb more sunlight than the others.",
