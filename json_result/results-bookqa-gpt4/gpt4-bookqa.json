        "prompt": "Evidence: \n1. **Indirect**: Consider if an organism's survival rate would be affected if its needs are somehow unrelated or loosely related to those needs. For example, if a plant needs sunlight but is in an area with little to no sunlight, would its survival rate be high or low? Would this relationship be seen as indirect?\n\n2. **Direct**: Think about whether an organism's survival rate improves when its needs are sufficiently met. For example, if a person gets proper nutrition, access to clean water, and healthcare, would their survival rate increase? If so, would this relationship be straightforward and clearly linked?\n\n3. **Inverse**: Reflect on scenarios where an increase in an organism's requirements might lead to a decrease in its survival rate, or vice versa. For example, if an animal requires more and more resources to survive, would its survival rate drop if those resources are limited? Does this indicate an opposite or inverse relationship?\n\n4. **Reverse**: Another angle could be to consider a reversing trend. If the needs of an organism increase, does its survival rate follow the same trend, or does it go in the exact opposite direction? Think about if higher demands consistently lead to decreased survival.\n\nBy analyzing these perspectives, hopefully, you can determine which term accurately describes the relationship between an organism's requirements and its survival rate.\nQuestion: Were the situation to be that all zebra were sterile,\nOptions:\nA. zebra would be endangered\nB. zebra would be overpopulated\nC. zebra would have babies\nD. zebra would die out\nBased on the evidence and your own knowlege, think about the question.\nThen answer the question in the final line, with the format 'The final answer is: X.', where X is the UNIQUE capitalized letter standing for the choice.",

        "prompt": "Evidence: \nRefraction occurs when light passes from one medium into another, causing it to change direction due to a change in its speed. This phenomenon is commonly observed when light passes through transparent or translucent materials, where the speed of light changes as it enters or exits different mediums. \n\n1. *Concrete walls*: Concrete walls are opaque and do not allow light to pass through them. Instead, they block light or reflect it, making them unsuitable for witnessing refraction.\n\n2. *Fake diamonds*: Fake diamonds, like real diamonds, are often made of materials such as cubic zirconia. These materials are transparent and have high refractive indices, meaning they bend light significantly. This causes light to slow down and change direction multiple times as it enters and exits the material, leading to distinct shining effects.\n\n3. *Christmas ornaments*: These decorations can be made of various materials, some of which may be transparent or semi-transparent like glass or clear plastic. When light passes through these materials, especially curved surfaces, you can observe refractive effects. The change in speed as light passes through the ornament material can create interesting visual distortions.\n\n4. *A tree*: A tree is largely opaque due to its solid structure composed of components like bark and leaves, which do not allow light to pass through in a manner that refraction would occur. Instead, trees mostly reflect or absorb light.\n\nBased on the explanation of the refraction phenomenon and the properties of the materials listed in the options, consider how transparent or translucent these options are and how they interact with light.

It is usually due to competition for resources, territory, or mating partners. Beak shape doesn't necessarily play a role in their emotions toward other birds. Birds' feelings, if they have them, are more likely influenced by territory and food competition rather than aesthetics.\n\n### Option B: Birds with angular beaks may chow down on different grub than birds with rounded beaks\nConsider how beak shape affects feeding. Different beak shapes are often adapted to different kinds of food. For example, a parrot’s curved beak is suited for cracking nuts, while a heron's sharp, pointed beak is designed for catching fish. Different beak structures allow birds to exploit different food sources effectively.\n\n### Option C: Birds with angular beaks will eat the exact same diet as all other birds\nThink about the diversity in the bird world. A hummingbird has a beak perfect for sipping nectar, while a hawk has a sharp beak for tearing meat. Saying that all birds eat the same diet overlooks these specializations, which evolved to help birds thrive in various environments.\n\n### Option D: Birds with angular beaks may have more trouble eating than other birds\nConsider how beak shape helps or hinders eating. If a beak is well adapted to its food source, the bird will generally have no trouble eating. Problems arise when a bird, for some reason, has to eat something its beak is not specialized for.

They are large raptors that are proficient hunters.\n\n2. **Typical Prey:**\n   - They often hunt mammals like rabbits, squirrels, and sometimes even larger animals such as foxes and young deer. Think about the size of the prey relative to the eagle's size and hunting capability.\n\n3. **Hunting Method:**\n   - They use their sharp talons to catch and kill their prey. Their talons are strong and designed to hold onto struggling animals, which gives a clue that their prey are usually animals that can be overpowered by the eagle's strength.\n\nNow, let's apply this thinking to the options provided:\n\n- **Groupers (A)**: These are large fish found in marine environments. Golden eagles are terrestrial hunters, although some eagles do specialize in catching fish, the term for such eagles is generally \"sea eagles\" or \"fishing eagles\".\n\n- **Berries (B)**: Berries are plants; although some birds do eat berries, predatory birds like golden eagles are typically carnivorous, relying on animal prey.\n\n- **Bears (C)**: Bears are immense animals, significantly larger and stronger than golden eagles. They are not a feasible target for an eagle.\n\n- **Humans (D)**: Eagles do not hunt humans. This idea might come from films or myths, but it is not a part of their natural hunting behavior.\n\nReflecting on these points should help narrow down the answer to what a golden eagle is most likely to collect using its talons.\nQuestion: A golden eagle will hunt using its talons to collect\nOptions:\nA. groupers\nB. berries\nC. bears\nD. humans\nBased on the evidence and your own knowlege, think about the question.\nThen answer the question in the final line, with the format 'The final answer is: X.', where X is the UNIQUE capitalized letter standing for the choice.",

Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy that can later be released to fuel the organisms' activities. This process involves sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide and occurs in the chlorophyll of green plants. It is primarily related to biological processes rather than geological ones.\n\n- **Audio feedback** refers to a phenomenon that occurs in acoustics. It generally describes the screeching sound when a microphone picks up sound from speakers that it is connected to, creating a loop of amplified sound. This concept is related to sound waves and audio engineering, not to the physical shaping of rocks.\n\n- **Hydro-erosion** (also known as water erosion) is a natural geological process that involves the removal of soil, rock, or dissolved material from one location on the Earth's crust, and the transport it to another location. This process can take place through different forms such as rivers, rain, waves, or glaciers, often rounding rocks as they are transported and collide with other rocks and sediments over time.\n\n- **Cloudy conditions** refer to the state of the weather when the sky is covered with clouds.

This behavior is typical for many animals preparing for hibernation or periods of scarcity.\n\n2. **Weighted**: This term generally means having weight. Although it may imply the beaver has some extra weight, it is not as specific as \"overweight\" and could be ambiguous in this context.\n\n3. **Underweight**: This term means having less body weight than is healthy or optimal. If the beaver were underweight, it would struggle to survive during the meager months of winter due to insufficient energy reserves.\n\n4. **Starved**: This condition means lacking sufficient food, leading to severe weakness or death. A starved beaver would not survive the winter months because it wouldn’t have the necessary energy reserves.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most appropriate answer is that the beaver ensures it can survive the meager winter months by being \"overweight.\"\n\nThe final answer is: A.",

Hypothermia can set in, causing lethargy and sleepiness as the body's core temperature drops.\n\nB. **energy levels increase**: This is unlikely because in a freezing environment, a person's energy would generally be used up faster to maintain body heat.\n\nC. **They live there**: This option doesn’t address the question directly. Living in the forest doesn’t explain why they would fall asleep after getting lost and cold.\n\nD. **A big meal**: While eating a big meal can make someone sleepy, it's less relevant to the context of being lost in a freezing environment. Falling asleep due to cold weather is more related to energy depletion and the body’s response to hypothermia.\n\nGiven these considerations, the decrease in energy levels due to the cold makes the most sense as it directly relates to the physiological responses to a cold environment.\n\nThe final answer is: A.",
        "model_answer_wo": "A person might fall asleep after being lost in a forest on a freezing cold day due to a decrease in energy levels and potentially the onset of hypothermia, where the body conserves energy to maintain vital functions.\n\nThe final answer is: A."

        "prompt": "Evidence: \n1. **Body Structure and Movement**:\n   - Tuna are known for their streamlined, torpedo-shaped bodies, which reduce water resistance and are ideal for high-speed swimming.\n   - Seahorses, on the other hand, have upright, rigid bodies that move more slowly and are not designed for speed.\n\n2. **Fins and Propulsion**:\n   - Tuna have large, powerful fins which allow them to generate significant propulsion and move swiftly through the water. These include their caudal (tail) fin which is designed for fast movement.\n   - Seahorses have small, delicate fins that allow for precise but slow maneuvering.\n\n3. **Adaptations for Speed**:\n   - Tuna are pelagic fish, meaning they live in the open ocean where they need to swim quickly to chase prey and avoid predators. Their fins and body shape enable them to swim at high speeds.\n   - Seahorses often inhabit calm, vegetated waters where speed is not necessary for survival. Their fin structures reflect their need for stability and fine control rather than speed.\n\nBy considering the above points, you can infer which physical attribute is responsible for the faster swimming speed of a tuna compared to a seahorse.\nQuestion: What does a tuna have that causes it to swim faster than a seahorse?\nOptions:\nA. Lower body temperature\nB. Bigger scales\nC. Bigger fins\nD.

        "model_answer_wo": "To determine the answer, we need to think about the physical attributes that contribute to a fish's swimming speed. \n\nA. Lower body temperature - Lower body temperature does not necessarily correlate with swimming speed.\n\nB. Bigger scales - While scales might provide some level of protection or streamline effect, they are not a primary determinant in swimming speed.\n\nC. Bigger fins - Fins play a significant role in the propulsion and maneuverability of aquatic animals. Bigger fins would likely provide greater thrust and better directional control.\n\nD. Thicker caudal fin - The caudal fin, also known as the tail fin, is crucial for propulsion. A thicker caudal fin can provide more powerful thrust, enhancing swimming speed.\n\nConsidering that caudal fins are the primary propulsion organs and their structure correlates directly with swimming speed, \n\nThe final answer is: D."
